## 🌟 Introduction

The **Product Dashboard** is a dynamic and intuitive application designed to help users efficiently manage, visualize, and track product inventory and sales data. Built using modern web technologies, it provides a centralized interface for monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) related to your product catalog.

This project was specifically designed to demonstrate robust state management using the **React Context API** and **`useReducer`** for handling complex product list logic, as requested.

## ✨ Features

The dashboard provides the following key functionalities:

* **Product List Management:** View, add, edit, and remove products from the inventory.
* **Global State Store:** Implements a single, centralized state store for product data using **Context API** and **`useReducer`**.
* **Filtering & Sorting:** Ability to filter products by category, price, or stock level, and sort the list by various metrics (e.g., name, price, date added).
* **Data Visualization:** *[Replace this with specifics: e.g., Charts for sales trends, stock levels, or popular items.]*
* **Responsive UI:** Designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
